    "Providing support is one of the most important responsibilities that a parent takes up when introducing a child into their lives. This parental involvement is what helps a child thrive in their early years and is the standard for a healthy household. The American Psychological Association conducted a survey regarding this relationship and found that poor mental health is strongly linked to lack of parental support. Their findings support the notion that parent support is vital as it sets the foundation for healthy self-esteem and perspective on love, and without it, the long-term effects could lead to depressive and melancholy symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era of increasingly common teen suicides, parental support could be a key factor in lowering these numbers. In an article from the University of Maryland College of Education, they cover the importance of a parent’s role in supporting their adolescent children as they face an overwhelming increase in bullying. Their data showed that parental involvement through the middle school years proved to benefit their academic achievement and socioemotional health, which is typically when parents start distancing themselves from their child’s academics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior works have shown that parental involvement does not go unnoticed, and it leads to a positive impact on their child’s well-being. A small step can go a long way for a child and their notion of great parenting will influence their parenting styles in the future, benefitting the next generation of children. Our objective as a group is to go deeper into this hereditary cascade and discover the long-term effects of parent involvement on their children’s mental health.\n",

    "We hypothesize that higher levels of parental involvement during early childhood, such as time spent breastfeeding or engaging in nurturing activities, are positively associated with better mental and physical health outcomes in adulthood. We expect that individuals who experienced greater parental engagement early in life will report lower rates of depression, anxiety, and chronic health issues as adults.",
