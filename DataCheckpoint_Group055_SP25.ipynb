    "\n",
    "    The data we are planning to analyze for this project may disproportionately represent demographic communities. For example, studies that rely on self-reported parental involvement or medical records might exclude populations with limited access to healthcare or different cultural parenting sub_dfs. To lessen these concerns, we will:\n",
    "   - Use diverse, representative datasets that encompass an extensive range of socioeconomic, cultural, and racial backgrounds\n",
    "   - Conduct a thorough review of the datasets to eliminate any biases\n",
    "   - Perform statistical analysis to check for sampling biases\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Privacy Concerns**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The characteristics of the data, usually including sensitive information about parental sub_dfs and health outcomes, pose notable risks to privacy. To address this issue:\n",
    "   - Prioritize the use of anonymized data to ensure no individual can be identified\n",
    "   - Adhere to strict data privacy sub_dfs, including encryption, restricted access, and compliance with data privacy regulations\n",
    "   - Communicate privacy protection protocols to all group members\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Biases in Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Framing parental involvement as a changeable variable could unintentionally disclose cultural or societal biases about gender roles. Also, our analysis could overemphasize some correlations while ignoring confounding variables. To mitigate this:\n",
    "   - Perform subgroup analyses to understand impacts across gender, race, and SES\n",
    "   - Control for confounders such as maternal involvement, SES, and healthcare access\n",
    "   - Apply ethical and statistical techniques to reduce model bias\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-Analysis Communication**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Misinterpretation of results could reinforce stereotypes or social inequalities. To prevent this, we will:\n",
    "   - Transparently report limitations and biases\n",
    "   - Include insights from underrepresented groups to ensure balanced conclusions\n",
    "   - Distribute findings in an accessible and culturally respectful manner\n",
