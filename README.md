# COGS 108 - Longitudinal Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains the code and materials for our final group project in COGS 108 at UC San Diego. Our final analysis is in the notebook: `FinalProject_Group055_SP25.ipynb`

## üß† Project Overview

In this research project, we explored whether there is a relationship between early-life emotional support and self-reported adult mental health outcomes. We were particularly interested in this idea as we were college students interested in how the brain/ mental health issues may develop.

## üéì Motivation

We were inspired by our coursework and personal interests in psychology and neuroscience. For part of our final, we created a video summarizing our findings and formatted our work like a research paper to better communicate our ideas.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

This project represents the culmination of what we learned in COGS 108. It also served as a hands-on opportunity to apply machine learning and data science principles using:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Python libraries for visualization** (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- **Evaluation Tools:**
  - Confusion matrices
  - Performance graphs

While we had learned about more models and techniques we could have utilized, we thought that these all would help us best understand our question.
